# My Data Analysis Portfolio

Hey there! First off, thank you for taking the time to take a look into my portfolio! Second, the purpose of this portfolio is to show my data anlysis related skills and their relevant projects. As Excel, SQL, and Python are perhaps the most important tools in data analytics. In each folder you will be able to look at various personal projects that I have worked on related to this particular skill!

Hope I can hear from you soon!
